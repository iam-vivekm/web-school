# Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for all record types in the EduManagePro system. Currently, the application only supports creating users and attendance records, with read operations for viewing data. This implementation will add delete and update functionality across all entities including users (students, teachers, parents, admins), attendance records, and enable proper data management through the admin and teacher portals.

## Types
No new type definitions required. The existing schema types (User, Attendance, InsertUser, InsertAttendance) already support all necessary fields for CRUD operations.

## Files
### New Files
- EduManagePro/EduManagePro/server/middleware.ts - Authentication middleware for admin-only operations

### Modified Files
- EduManagePro/EduManagePro/server/storage.ts - Add delete and update methods to IStorage interface and DatabaseStorage class
- EduManagePro/EduManagePro/server/routes.ts - Add DELETE and PUT endpoints for users and attendance records
- EduManagePro/EduManagePro/client/src/components/AdminPortal.tsx - Add onClick handlers for Edit and Delete buttons in all admin tables
- EduManagePro/EduManagePro/client/src/components/TeacherPortal.tsx - Add onClick handlers for Edit and Delete buttons in teacher tables

### Configuration Files
No configuration changes required.

## Functions
### New Functions
- deleteUser(id: string): Promise<void> - Remove user from database
- updateUser(id: string, user: Partial<InsertUser>): Promise<User> - Update user information
- deleteAttendance(id: string): Promise<void> - Remove attendance record
- updateAttendance(id: string, attendance: Partial<InsertAttendance>): Promise<Attendance> - Update attendance record
- requireAdmin middleware function - Ensure only admin users can perform destructive operations

### Modified Functions
- AdminStudents, AdminTeachers, AdminParents components - Add handleDelete and handleEdit functions
- TeacherAssignments component - Add handleDelete and handleEdit functions

## Classes
### Modified Components
- AdminPortal components (AdminStudents, AdminTeachers, AdminParents, AdminClasses, AdminFees, AdminExams, AdminNotices) - Add state management for edit modals and delete confirmations
- TeacherPortal components (TeacherAssignments) - Add state management for edit modals and delete confirmations

## Dependencies
No new dependencies required. All necessary UI components (Dialog, AlertDialog, Button) are already available in the existing component library.

## Testing
### Unit Tests
- Test deleteUser and updateUser storage methods
- Test deleteAttendance and updateAttendance storage methods
- Test authentication middleware for admin-only operations
- Test API endpoints for proper error handling and validation

### Integration Tests
- Test complete CRUD workflows through the UI
- Test admin permission enforcement
- Test data consistency after updates and deletes
- Test cascade delete scenarios (e.g., deleting user with attendance records)

### Manual Testing
- Verify delete operations show confirmation dialogs
- Test edit functionality updates records correctly
- Ensure admin-only operations are properly restricted
- Test error handling for invalid operations
- Verify UI updates after successful operations

## Implementation Order
1. Add delete and update methods to storage interface and implementation
2. Create authentication middleware for admin operations
3. Add DELETE and PUT API routes with proper validation
4. Update AdminPortal components with delete and edit functionality
5. Update TeacherPortal components with delete and edit functionality
6. Test all CRUD operations end-to-end
7. Add proper error handling and user feedback
